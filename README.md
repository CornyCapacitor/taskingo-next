# Taskingo ðŸ“Œ
**Taskingo** is my first full-scale project, designed with a strong focus on user utility. Interestingly, Iâ€™ve built this app three times already! The first version was created while learning React, the second one in pure TypeScript to refine my vanilla skills, and the third one using Next.js, improving the app with each iteration and refactoring. It is a self-organization tool that allows users to create their own boards, manage lists and organize tasks in an intuitive way.
